# SayWhat?!

A full stack blog-like application utilizing MongoDB, Node, Express, and EJS. Allows users to register and login to an account, create posts, search for posts and follow other users and their posts. Created with the aid of a tutorial with the intent of gaining more full stack knowledge with the use of EJS instead of React and to gain a better understanding of the MVC pattern.
